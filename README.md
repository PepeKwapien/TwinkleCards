## Motivation

I needed to organize my flashcards with japanese words ðŸ˜…

It was so frustrating to search for that one specific word and not being able to find it in Google Translator or [Jisho](https://jisho.org/)

## How to use

You are free to create as many collections as you want. You can interact with flashcards and learn with them by displaying them in random order

You can also share the link to your collection with friends
